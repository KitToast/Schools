# Material for Schools and Workshops on Univalent Mathematics

## Installation
1. Follow instructions [Preparing your computer](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/INSTALL.md#preparing-your-computer) of the [UniMath installation guide](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
2. Follow instructions [Installation of ProofGeneral](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/INSTALL.md#installation-of-proofgeneral-all-operating-systems) of the [UniMath installation guide](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
3. Type the following into a terminal:
   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/UniMath/Workshops
   $ cd Workshops
   $ make
   ```
   This last step will take a long time: as part of that step, UniMath and Coq are downloaded and compiled.
